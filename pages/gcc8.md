# gcc-8

OpenBSD includes `gcc` in the base install. However, it includes `gcc-4.2.1`.
If you prefer to use `gcc-8.3.0`, the names of the binaries differ so as to not
conflict with `gcc` in base.

* `egcc` - gcc
* `eg++` - g++
* `egdb` - gdb
* `egfortran` - g95 / gfortran

The exception being `gnat`.
