# Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup

`dcss` is a fun roguelike game that is now available on a tildeverse server
for your enjoyment. There are two ways to play: via `WebTiles` for simple
2d graphics and via `ssh` for a more traditional ascii interface.

* CTVO: [https://crawl.tildeverse.org](https://crawl.tildeverse.org)

If you already have an account on tilde.institute, you can play via the
ascii interface by issuing the command `dcss`. This will automatically
connect to the server and present the login/registration menu.

Some users prefer graphics. For `WebTiles`, it will be necessary to go to
[https://crawl.tildeverse.org](https://crawl.tildeverse.org). Click `PLAY`
to open the `WebTiles` interface.

## Recorded Games

All games on CTVO (the tildeverse crawl server) are recorded for later
playback. In order to review a previously recorded game, navigate to [the
ttyrec directory](https://crawl.tildeverse.org/ttyrec), select a username,
and download the `ttyrec` file. You'll need to have the `ttyrec` package
installed in order to review them. Issue: `ttyplay file.ttyrec` and watch
as your terminal automagically transforms into a recorded DCSS game.

`ttyplay` is installed on tilde.institute, so feel free to download a
game to your home directory and watch it from there.

## Morgue Files

Want to see the run-down of a game? Check out the `morgue`
file for it. They're sorted into username directories at:
[https://crawl.tildeverse.org/morgue](https://crawl.tildeverse.org/morgue).
Each `morgue` file contains information such as how you died, your stats,
an account of monsters vanquished, among other stuff.
